# matringale_simulator
A short program which allows you simulate the martingale system of betting. 

The Martingale System:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(betting_system)

This program allows you to adjust your total fund amount, bet amount and total number of bet iterations for a Martingale system of betting in a game of roulette.

You can also adjust probability of winning. (Default has been set to 46%)

If you lose all your money it declares the lost amount, win probability and bet number at which yuo lost.

If you win it returns the total fund and rate of return for x number of bets.

You can directly adjust the parameters through the C++ code. I'm currently working on a processing based front end interface for the same.
